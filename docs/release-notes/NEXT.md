<!-- The human summary of the NEXT release. Add a line here in your PR when the change is visible
     to a user or an operator. On release, .github/workflows/release-please.yml puts this text on
     top of the GitHub Release (release-please's changelog stays below a `---`), adds the thanks to
     the outside contributors it finds by itself, and opens a PR that empties this file again.
     Do not edit the three headings; a section with no line under it is left out of the release.
     Rules and the script: CONTRIBUTING -> Releases, scripts/release_notes.py. -->

## Highlights

<!-- One line per change a user will notice: `- **Short name:** what changed and why it matters.` -->

- **Labs that run:** a generated lab now has the `break`, `verify` and `cleanup` modes the lab runner needs and never waits at a prompt, or it is not written; `teach cert lab` rewrites only a topic's lab.
- **Moved citations, fixed in one step:** `scripts/fix_citation.py` replaces a dead documentation URL in every language of a topic and keeps the translations' source chain current, without paying for a re-translation.

## Upgrade notes

<!-- What an operator must do or watch when upgrading (a new required value, a changed default). -->

## Thanks

<!-- Only for credit the script cannot find, e.g. a reviewer or a reporter: `- @user for what (#N)`.
     Authors of merged outside PRs are added automatically as `@user (#N)`. -->
